# Problem 65
Thank you for giving me the oppotunity of challenging the tech test. 
To be honest, it is the best tech test I've ever taken. I really enjoy (also struggled) the entire process

## Why I choose
I reviewed a couple of problems and some looks easy and some looks so hard.
Then I found that the problem 65 looked suitable for my ability to challenge and I also love Euler's number e.

## Steps
1. I carefully read the problem what is required to be solved.
2. Built a plan how to approach the goal and thought about the backup plan too
3. Made a research (what formula that I need to solve it, what knowledge I was missing)
4. Coding & test (Sorry I didn't include any test code this time but if you need I'm very happy to add them)

## Story
1. The tech stack I required is React & NodeJs, so I started to writing the code in javascript
 and then I realised the calculation was overflowed after written all code
 because the maximum number can be handled in JS is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER constant, approx 9 quadrillion (9 followed by 15 zeros).
 but I enclosed js version for my skill references. (I'm happy to rewrite them in typescript as well if I need it)

2. I rewrote the code by python which is really stable for calculation work

## Review the code
1. Before reviewing the code please take a look at problem65.png for the explation of the problem 
2. Python version can calculate successfully 100th convergent
3. Javascript one shows the calculation of 10th convergent as sample
